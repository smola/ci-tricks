# ci-tricks [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smola/ci-tricks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smola/ci-tricks)  [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/smola/ci-tricks?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/smola/ci-tricks) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/smola/ci-tricks/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/smola/ci-tricks)

**ci-tricks** is a single-binary that can be run on multiple continuous integration providers to setup the environment in an efficient way.

**WARNING: This approach is hacky, dirty and ugly. It is meant to provide some last resort hacks for projects that run on multiple CI providers and platforms.**

## Supported platforms

* Appveyor/Windows/amd64
* Travis/Linux/amd64 ([sudo-enabled](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/#Sudo-enabled))
* Travis/macOS/amd64
* Travis/Windows/amd64

## Usage

1. Set the environment variables as required by each trick.
2. Run `ci-tricks`.

On Travis CI you can run latest `ci-tricks` version with:

```yaml
install:
  - wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smola/ci-tricks/master/get.sh | bash
```

On Appveyor you can use:

```yaml
install:
  - ps: iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smola/ci-tricks/master/get.ps1'))
```

## Tricks

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL can be set up by setting the `POSTGRESQL_VERSION` environment variable to the desired PostgreSQL version.
